The “Licensed Materials” subject to this Agreement include the software programs (in whole or in part), set forth in Exhibit A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, that accompany this Agreement and which you access “on-line” and/or electronic documentation (in whole or in part) associated and provided with these programs, as well as any updates or upgrades to such software programs and documentation, if any, provided to you at TI’s sole discretion.  The Licensed Materials are specifically designed and licensed for use solely and exclusively with processing devices manufactured by or for TI (“TI Devices”).  By installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed Materials you agree to abide by the provisions set forth herein.  This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to using the Licensed Materials.  If you choose not to accept or agree with these provisions, do not download or install the Licensed Materials.  

Note Regarding Possible Access to Open Source Software:  The Licensed Materials may be bundled with Open Source Software.  "Open Source Software" means any software licensed under terms requiring that (A) other software (“Proprietary Software”) incorporated, combined or distributed with such software or developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the Proprietary Software on or with devices other than TI Devices, or (B) require the owner of Proprietary Software to license any of its patents to users of the Open Source Software and/or Proprietary Software incorporated, combined or distributed with such Open Source Software or developed using such Open Source Software. 

By accepting this Agreement, you may gain access to Open Source Software, in which case such Open Source Software will be listed in the applicable software manifest (in whole or in part, the “Open Source Materials”).  Your use of the Open Source Materials is subject to the separate licensing terms applicable to such Open Source Materials as specified in the applicable software manifest.  For clarification, this Agreement does not limit your rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the license terms of any applicable Open Source Materials license agreement.  If any of the Open Source Materials have been provided to you in object code only, TI will provide to you or show you where can access the source code versions of such Open Source Materials if you contact TI at Texas Instruments Incorporated, 12500 TI Boulevard, Mail Station 8638, Dallas, Texas 75243, Attention: Contracts Manager.  You may terminate this Agreement in the event you choose not to accept or agree with the terms in any applicable Open Source Materials license agreement, provided that such termination occurs within five (5) days of acceptance of this Agreement and you abide by all applicable license terms in this Agreement until such termination. 

1.	License Grant and Use Restrictions.  

a.	Licensed Materials License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, TI grants to you the following limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sub-licensable, royalty-free licenses to the Licensed Materials:  

i.	Limited Source Code License.  You may make and have made copies, prepare derivative works, display internally and use internally the Licensed Materials provided in source code for the sole purpose of developing object and executable versions of such Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, for use in IPNC products that include the Licensed Materials (or such derivative works made pursuant to this license grant) running solely and exclusively on TI Devices (such products hereafter referred to as “Customer Products”), and maintaining and supporting such Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, and Customer Products.  You agree that this source code license is site specific and is solely for the location where the Licensed Materials are downloaded, and that you will not move any source code version of the Licensed Materials, or any derivative thereof, to any other location without TI’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  You shall maintain the source code versions of the Licensed Materials under password control protection.

ii.	Development License.  You may make copies, display internally, distribute internally and use internally object code and executable versions of the Licensed Materials for the sole purposes of designing and developing Customer Products, and maintaining and supporting Customer Products.    

iii.	Distribution License.  You may distribute binary versions of the Licensed Materials or such derivative works made pursuant to Section 1(a) above, only as part of Customer Products.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as permitting you to distribute source code versions of the Licensed Materials or versions of Licensed Materials that operate independently of Customer Products. 

iv.	Reference Design License.  You may make, use, import, export and otherwise distribute Customer Products you have developed using the Reference Design, but you may not sub-license or otherwise transfer or divulge the Reference Design to any third party or use the Reference Design or any part thereof in the development of any other product.  You do not obtain any rights to the Reference Design other than as explicitly granted in this Agreement. “Reference Design” means solely the Schematic, Gerber and Bill of Materials (BOM) documentation included with the Licensed Materials, and does not include any of the other Licensed Materials provided under this Agreement.

b.	Contractors and Suppliers.  The licenses granted to you hereunder shall include your on-site and off-site suppliers and independent contractors, while such suppliers and independent contractors are performing work for or providing services to you, provided that such suppliers and independent contractors have executed work-for-hire agreements with you containing applicable terms and conditions consistent with the terms and conditions set forth is this Agreement, and provided further that you agree you are responsible for the breach of this Agreement by any of your suppliers or contractors to the same extent that you would be if you breached the Agreement yourself.

You covenant not to sue or otherwise assert Derived Patents against TI and TI’s affiliates and their licensees of the Licensed Materials.  In the event you assign a Derived Patent, you shall require as a condition of any such assignment that the assignee agree to be bound by the provisions in this Section 1(c) with respect to such Derived Patent.  Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 1(c) shall be null and void.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Derived Patents” means any of your patents issuing from a patent application that discloses and claims an invention conceived of by you after delivery of the Licensed Materials, and derived by you from your access to the Licensed Materials. 

d.	No Other License.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a license to any intellectual property rights of TI other than those rights embodied in the Licensed Materials provided to you by TI.
